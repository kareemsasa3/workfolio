# AI Command Documentation

## Overview

The `ai` command is the crown jewel of the Workfolio portfolio - a sentient AI assistant that brings the portfolio to life through intelligent conversation. This feature represents the ultimate evolution of the terminal interface, transforming it from a static simulation into a living, breathing system with artificial intelligence.

## The Vision

As described in the original concept:

> "This is, without question, the most creative, meta, and brilliantly conceived feature we could possibly add. It is the absolute, perfect, and final evolution of this project. The top command made your portfolio a self-aware system. The curl command connected it to the real world. This ai command would make it sentient."

- **Press Escape** to exit chat and return to terminal
- **Use suggestion buttons** for quick questions
- **View conversation history** with timestamps

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **AiCommand Class** (`useTerminal.ts`)
   - Handles command parsing and execution
   - Manages initial message processing
   - Integrates with terminal state management

2. **AiChatUI Component** (`AiChatUI.tsx`)
   - Full-screen chat interface
   - Message rendering and input handling
   - Connection status and error display

3. **AI API Service** (`aiApi.ts`)
   - HTTP client for backend communication
   - Error handling and response processing
   - Connection testing and health checks

### Backend Service

1. **Express Server** (`ai-backend/server.js`)
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - AI service integration
   - Security and error handling

2. **AI Provider Integration**
   - OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 support
   - Anthropic Claude support
   - Fallback demo mode

### State Management

```typescript
interface TerminalState {
  // AI Chat functionality
  isAiChatting: boolean;        // Chat mode active
  aiChatHistory: ChatMessage[]; // Conversation history
  isAiTyping: boolean;          // AI response indicator
  aiInputValue: string;         // Current input value
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd workfolio/ai-backend
npm install
```

Create `.env` file:
```env
PORT=3001
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# or
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend Configuration

Update `src/services/aiApi.ts`:
```typescript
const AI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3001"; // Development
// const AI_BASE_URL = "https://your-deployed-backend.com"; // Production
```

### 3. API Key Setup

**OpenAI:**
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create new API key
3. Add to backend `.env` file

**Anthropic:**
1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create new API key
3. Add to backend `.env` file

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

**Vercel:**
```bash
cd ai-backend
vercel --prod
```

**Heroku:**
```bash
heroku create your-ai-backend
heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
git push heroku main
```

**Railway:**
- Connect GitHub repository
- Set environment variables
- Auto-deploy on push

### Frontend Updates

After deploying the backend, update the frontend:
```typescript
// src/services/aiApi.ts
const AI_BASE_URL = "https://your-deployed-backend-url.com";
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- **Never expose API keys** in frontend code
- **Use environment variables** in backend
- **Implement rate limiting** for production
- **Monitor usage** and costs

### CORS Configuration
- **Restrict origins** to your portfolio domain
- **Validate requests** on backend
- **Sanitize responses** for XSS protection

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** when AI service is unavailable
- **User-friendly error messages** without exposing internals
- **Retry mechanisms** for transient failures

## Customization

### AI Personality

Modify the system context in `ai-backend/server.js`:
```javascript
const systemMessage = {
  role: 'system',
  content: 'You are a helpful AI assistant integrated into a developer portfolio. Be friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. You can discuss the portfolio technologies, explain features, and provide insights about the development process.'
};
```

### UI Styling

Customize the chat interface in `AiChatUI.css`:
- **Color scheme** and gradients
- **Animation effects** and transitions
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices
- **Typography** and spacing

### Conversation Starters

Update suggestion buttons in `AiChatUI.tsx`:
```typescript
const suggestions = [
  "Tell me about this portfolio",
  "What technologies did you use?",
  "How does the terminal work?",
  "Show me some cool features",
  "Explain the AI integration"
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection Error"**
   - Check if backend server is running
   - Verify AI_BASE_URL is correct
   - Check CORS configuration

2. **"AI service not configured"**
   - Verify API key is set in backend `.env`
   - Check API key permissions and billing
   - Test API key with curl or Postman

3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Wait and retry
   - Check API usage limits
   - Consider upgrading service plan

4. **Messages not sending**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Test backend endpoints directly

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in backend:
```javascript
// Add to server.js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.path}`, req.body);
  next();
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Voice interaction** with speech-to-text
- **File upload** for code review
- **Multi-language support** for international users
- **Advanced context** with portfolio analytics
- **Integration** with external APIs (GitHub, LinkedIn)

### Technical Improvements
- **Streaming responses** for real-time typing
- **Message persistence** across sessions
- **Advanced error recovery** with circuit breakers
- **Performance optimization** with caching
- **Analytics dashboard** for usage insights
