# üöÄ Workfolio - Interactive Developer Portfolio

[Live Demo](https://kareemsasadev.netlify.app)

An innovative, interactive portfolio that transforms the traditional resume into a living, breathing development environment. Built with React, TypeScript, and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the browser.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This front-end application is part of a larger ecosystem of specialized, independently deployable services:

```
/your-projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workfolio/       # This repository - Front-end React application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-backend/      # AI microservice (standalone)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arachne/         # Web scraping service (standalone)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ buildsync/       # Full-stack application (standalone)
```

Each service is designed to be independent while working together to create a comprehensive portfolio experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ### `git clone https://github.com/kareemsasa3/workfolio.git`

2. Install dependencies
   ### `npm install`

3. Run the development server
   ### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### ü§ñ AI Backend Setup (Optional)

For full AI functionality, you'll need to run the standalone AI backend service:

1. Clone the AI backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-backend.git
   cd ai-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies and configure environment:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your AI API keys
   ```

3. Start the AI backend service:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The AI backend will run on `http://localhost:3001` and the front-end will automatically connect to it.


# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run any of the following scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
