# üöÄ Workfolio - Interactive Developer Portfolio

[Live Site](https://kareemsasa.dev)

An innovative, interactive portfolio that transforms the traditional resume into a living, breathing development environment. Built with React, TypeScript, and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the browser.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This front-end application is part of a larger ecosystem of specialized, independently deployable services:

```
/your-projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workfolio/       # This repository - Front-end React application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-backend/      # AI microservice (standalone)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arachne/         # Web scraping service (standalone)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ buildsync/       # Full-stack application (standalone)
```

Each service is designed to be independent while working together to create a comprehensive portfolio experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ### `git clone https://github.com/kareemsasa3/workfolio.git`

2. Install dependencies
   ### `npm install`

3. Run the development server
   ### `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### ü§ñ AI Backend Setup (Optional)

For full AI functionality, you'll need to run the standalone AI backend service:

1. Navigate to the AI backend service in this repository:
   ```bash
   # From the repo root
   cd services/ai-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies and configure environment:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your AI API keys
   ```

3. Start the AI backend service:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The AI backend will run on `http://localhost:3001` and the front-end will automatically connect to it (via `/api/ai` when using the dev Nginx proxy or `VITE_AI_BACKEND_URL` when running standalone).


# Available Scripts (Vite)
In the project directory, you can run any of the following scripts:

### `npm run dev`
Starts the Vite development server.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder (configured via Vite).

### `npm run preview`
Locally preview the production build.

### `npm run lint`
Run ESLint on the codebase.

## Dev vs Prod

- Development (Docker Compose):
  - Command: `docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml -f infrastructure/dev/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
  - Nginx: HTTP-only `infrastructure/nginx/conf.d/default.dev.conf`
  - Proxies:
    - `/` ‚Üí `workfolio:80`
    - `/api/ai/*` ‚Üí `ai-backend:3001`
    - `/api/scrape/*`, `/api/arachne/*` ‚Üí `arachne:8080`
  - Frontend local dev: `npm run dev` in `workfolio/` also works (set `VITE_AI_BACKEND_URL` if not using Nginx)

- Production (Docker Compose):
  - Command: `docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml -f infrastructure/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
  - Nginx: HTTPS templated config `infrastructure/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.template` (rendered at container start)
  - Proxies: same paths as development
  - Frontend image served by Nginx; no dev server in production
